## üè∑Ô∏è Adding New Projects

To add a new project:
1. Ensure your project fits under **HTML**, **CSS**, or **JavaScript**.
2. Create a new directory and name it descriptively (e.g., `responsive-navbar`, `color-changer`).
3. Add all your project files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, etc.) inside the new directory.
4. Make sure your project has a `README.md` file describing:
   - What the project does.
   - How to set up and run the project.
   - Screenshots or GIFs (optional but recommended).

You can improve existing projects by:
1. Fixing bugs or issues listed in the repository.
2. Adding new features.
3. Improving the UI/UX.
4. Optimizing the code for better performance.

Make sure to:
